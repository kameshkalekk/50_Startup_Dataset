Startup Success Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview:
This project aims to predict the success of startup ventures using linear regression modeling techniques. By analyzing various factors such as funding, team size, location, and industry, we develop a predictive model to forecast the potential success or failure of startups.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilized a comprehensive dataset containing information about 50 startup ventures, including their funding, expenses, and profit.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted thorough data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Selection: Identified the most relevant features using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance ranking.
Model Development: Developed a linear regression model to predict the profitability of startup ventures based on the selected features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
Insights and Recommendations: Provided insights into the factors that significantly impact startup success and offered recommendations for aspiring entrepreneurs.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
